                            <p>Teresa is an exceptional yoga instructor. As my practice guide she always encouraged me to explore the possibilities and listen to my body. Under her instruction, I found balance – both mental and physical – that I never imagined. Patient, committed, accomplished and sometimes pregnant, Teresa brought energy, positivity and skill to every session and helped me reach new limits in my practice.</p>

                            <span class="bordered-icon"><i class="fa fa-th-large"></i></span>
                            <p>Without my doula, Teresa, I would have not had the natural birth after cesarean section that I did. My first daughters birth was confusing and heartbreaking (except of course falling in love with my perfect healthy beautiful daughter). I had been afraid of childbirth since I was a little girl but I thought that because I was physically fit and very much a practicing yogi that birth would be intuitive and natural. Turns out I was very wrong. Everything I "felt" like I should do was the opposite. Without teresas support, I would have never experienced the true joy and pain of childbirth. The confidence that came from this experience was surprising and  utterly invaluable. A doula can provide what a partner cannot. They stand for what you are committed to. Unlike your partner who loves you and wants to protect you from pain, a doula like Teresa sees the big picture. Facing my fear of childbirth has satisfied something for me that I never knew was possible. Thanks to my doula Teresa.</p>

                            <p>Birth is an intensely physical challenge and a uniquely emotional time.  During active labor, we fluctuated rapidly between the peaks of tension and the valleys of rest.  We invited Teresa to support, coach, and assist in the journey of birthing our first child. Teresa’s presence helped to alleviate our stress and confusion even though we had to disregard our birth plan almost immediately.  Looking back, Teresa’s involvement facilitated a smooth transition into parenthood for both of us.</p>
                            <p>I strongly recommend Teresa as she knew exactly what to do and when to do it.  Though my wife went into labor a full month early, Teresa appeared by our side instantly.  In the whirlwind of labor and delivery, she was a breath of fresh air as well as an advocate for my wife and baby.  When my wife needed relief from the pressure of contractions in multiple places, Teresa used her hands to help my wife.  When the contractions stopped for a moment, Teresa provided essential oils that she and my wife had previously discussed.  I would not have thought that the scent of lavender would soothe my wife and allow her to rest—but it did.  After the birth, I had to leave my wife’s side in order to stay with our premature baby; knowing that Teresa remained with my wife gave me peace of mind.  Last but not least, after a long, hectic day during which we forgot to eat, Teresa returned to the hospital with delicious food, which we truly appreciated.  If you are looking for a doula, do not hesitate to secure Teresa.  We are eternally grateful for her services during our daughter’s birth.</p>
