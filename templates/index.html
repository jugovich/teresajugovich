                            <p>Without my doula, Teresa, I would have not had the natural birth after cesarean section that I did. My first daughters birth was confusing and heartbreaking (except of course falling in love with my perfect healthy beautiful daughter). I had been afraid of childbirth since I was a little girl but I thought that because I was physically fit and very much a practicing yogi that birth would be intuitive and natural. Turns out I was very wrong. Everything I "felt" like I should do was the opposite. Without teresas support, I would have never experienced the true joy and pain of childbirth. The confidence that came from this experience was surprising and  utterly invaluable. A doula can provide what a partner cannot. They stand for what you are committed to. Unlike your partner who loves you and wants to protect you from pain, a doula like Teresa sees the big picture. Facing my fear of childbirth has satisfied something for me that I never knew was possible. Thanks to my doula Teresa.</p>

                            <p>We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work.</p>
